# BLOG-LLM
This blog llm is nothinng but an llm created using llama2 which has trained with over 2.76 billion parameters and in the app.py i have written a code to create different columns such as topic column which we are willing to create the limit of how many words we should use and the create the blog according to the person such as common person or data scientist in that way. People who are willing to do this project better use an local machine that has a better GPU like gaming laptops which can read the data efficiently and takes less time to run.i have downloaded llama2 from huggin face and for executing of the program 

run--->streamlit run app.py  
which opens in an webpage giving the columns we created and the output which means the creation of the blog may take time due to the lacal machine GPU I personally got the output after several minutes
